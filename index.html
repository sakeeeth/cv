        <p1><em>Student of <a href="https://www.forsyth.k12.ga.us/riverwatchms">Riverwatch Middle School</a>
        <br>
        8th grade
        <br>
        Student of <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/">The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp</a></em></p1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p1>I am a student at <a href="https://www.forsyth.k12.ga.us/riverwatchms">Riverwatch Middle School</a>. Next year, I plan on going to <a href="https://www.forsyth.k12.ga.us/alliance">Alliance Academy for Innovation</a> for high school. However, students have to be admitted to the school through a lottery system, where they randomly pick students admitted to join the school. If I don't get chosen for <a href="https://www.forsyth.k12.ga.us/alliance">Alliance</a>, my next option is <a href="https://www.forsyth.k12.ga.us/lhs">Lambert High School</a>, where my brother went. I have my parents and my brother in my family. My dad works with <a href="https://www.adp.com/">IT</a> and my mom works with <a href="https://www.chase.com/">finance</a>. My brother is currently in college studying to become a doctor. I am not sure what I plan on doing in the future, but I am not worried yet. I am good at math and I do like to code and build, so I might go into the field of computer science.</p1>
